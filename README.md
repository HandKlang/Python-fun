# Python-fun
 A personal learning and development repository focused on building proficiency in Python programming. 
 
 The primary goal of this project is to explore Python through hands-on experimentation, creative projects, and tool development.
 While the initial phase is centered around strengthening core Python skills, the long-term vision is to apply this knowledge to real-world use cases in energy management and renewable energy systems. 
 This includes developing scripts, simulations, and data-driven tools that support smarter, more sustainable energy solutions.
